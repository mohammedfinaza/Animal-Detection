# Animal-Detection
 This project is an advanced animal detection and notification system designed to identify various animals in real-time using a YOLO object detection model. The system leverages a combination of computer vision
 techniques, email, and SMS notifications to alert users when specific animals are detected. This solution is particularly useful for wildlife monitoring, security in rural areas, and preventing human-wildlife conflicts.
